# Booking.com Transparency Redesign

**Duration:** January 2025 — April 2025

## Project Overview

This UX project focuses on improving pricing transparency on Booking.com by addressing user frustrations around hidden fees and unclear policies. The objective was to help users make more confident booking decisions through better cost visibility.

## Key Activities

- Interviewed a diverse mix of travelers (backpackers, business/leisure users, agent-dependent, and OTA power users) to explore pain points around hidden fees and unclear pricing.
- Used 4x4 matrices and journey mapping to synthesize insights and empathize with users’ emotional and functional pain points throughout the booking process.
- Defined personas and mapped user goals to keep the solution grounded in real needs.
- Created high-fidelity prototypes using Figma.
- Conducted A/B testing to compare usability and user preference.
- Refined design based on feedback.
- Presented findings and solutions as part of the final presentation.

## Design Challenge

> “How might we empower users to make confident decisions through clearer cost communication?”

## Solution

Designed a toggle-based price breakdown feature that displays total costs upfront on the property listings page. This was selected after A/B testing against an overlay pop-up prototype, with users favoring the toggle for its simplicity, clarity, and ease of comparison while browsing.
